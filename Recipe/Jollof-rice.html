<h3>ingredients</h3>

<li>1/2 cup tomato paste</li>
  <li>2–3 fresh tomatoes, blended</li>
  <li>1–2 red bell peppers, blended</li>
  <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
  <li>2–3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
  <li>2 cups chicken or beef stock (or water if none available)
</li>
  <li>2 seasoning cubes (like Maggi or Knorr)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
  <li>1–2 bay leaves</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
</ul>
<h4>steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Rinse the parboiled rice thoroughly in cold water and set aside.</li>
  <li>Blend the fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, Scotch bonnet, and one onion into a smooth paste.</li>
  <li>Heat vegetable oil in a pot and sauté chopped onions until translucent.</li>
  <li>Add tomato paste to the pot and fry for 3–5 minutes to reduce the sourness.</li>
  <li>Pour in the blended pepper mixture and cook until the liquid reduces and the sauce thickens.</li>
  <li>Season the sauce with curry powder, thyme, seasoning cubes, bay leaves, and salt to taste.</li>
  <li>Add chicken or beef stock and stir well. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil.</li>
  <li>Pour in the rinsed rice and stir so the grains are fully coated with the sauce.</li>
  <li>Reduce the heat, cover the pot with a tight lid or foil, and let the rice cook slowly by steaming.</li>
  <li>Check and stir occasionally to prevent burning. Add a splash of water or stock if needed.</li>
  <li>Once the rice is soft, remove the lid and let it steam uncovered for a few minutes to dry out slightly.</li>
  <li>Fluff the rice with a fork, serve hot, and garnish with fried plantains or grilled chicken if desired.</li>
</ol>
