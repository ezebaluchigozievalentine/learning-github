    <h2>Delicious Fried Plantains</h2>
<p>Fried plantains are a classic West African comfort food—crispy on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside. They’re made by slicing ripe plantains diagonally and frying them until golden brown. Perfect as a snack or side dish, they pair wonderfully with rice, beans, or spicy stews.</p>
<p>To prepare this dish, start by choosing ripe plantains with black or dark yellow skins for extra sweetness. Peel and slice them, then fry in vegetable oil over medium heat until each piece is beautifully caramelized. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt or cinnamon, and serve hot for the ultimate taste experience.</p>
