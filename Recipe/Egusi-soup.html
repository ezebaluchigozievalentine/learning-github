    <h2>Rich and Flavorful Egusi Soup</h2>
<p>Egusi soup is one of Nigeria’s most beloved dishes, known for its bold flavors and hearty texture. Made from ground melon seeds (egusi), this soup is thickened with palm oil and often enriched with leafy greens, meat, and fish. The result is a richly seasoned stew that's both nourishing and deeply satisfying—perfect with pounded yam, fufu, or rice.</p>
<p>To create this culinary masterpiece, egusi seeds are ground and fried into a paste before being simmered with meat stock, palm oil, onions, and assorted proteins like beef, goat meat, and dried fish. Bitterleaf or spinach is often added for a fresh kick, while native spices and seasoning cubes bring out a signature taste that warms the soul.</p>
